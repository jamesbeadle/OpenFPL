        Please see the below OpenFPL fantasy football gameplay rules.

      <p class="my-2">
        Each user begins with £300m to purchase players for their team. The
        value of a player can go up or down depending on how the player is rated
        in the DAO. Provided a certain voting threshold is reached for either a
        £0.25m increase or decrease, the player's value will change in that
        gameweek. A players value can only change when the season is active 
        (the first game has kicked off and the final game has not finished).
      </p>

      <p class="my-2">
        Each team has 11 players, with no more than 2 selected from any single
        team. The team must be in a valid formation, with 1 goalkeeper, 3-5
        defenders, 3-5 midfielders and 1-3 strikers.
      </p>

      <p class="my-2">
        Users will setup their team before the gameweek deadline each week. When
        playing OpenFPL, users have the chance to win FPL tokens depending on
        how well the players in their team perform.
      </p>

      <p class="my-2">In January, a user can change their entire team once.</p>

      <p class="my-2">
        A user is allowed to make 3 transfers per week which are never carried
        over.
      </p>

      <p class="my-2">
        Each week a user can select a star player. This player will receive
        double points for the gameweek. If one is not set by the start of the
        gameweek it will automatically be set to the most valuable player in
        your team.
      </p>

      <h2 class="default-sub-header">Points</h2>
      <p class="my-2">
        The user can get the following points during a gameweek for their team:
