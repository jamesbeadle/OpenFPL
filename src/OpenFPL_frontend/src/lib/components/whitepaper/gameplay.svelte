  <h1 class="default-header">OpenFPL Gameplay</h1>
  <p class="my-4">
    At OpenFPL, our gameplay rules are designed to create an immersive,
    engaging, and unique fantasy football experience. We understand the passion
    and strategy that goes into fantasy football, and our gameplay rules are
    crafted to reflect this, enhancing the fun and competitiveness of each
    gameweek.
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-header">Starting Funds and Team Composition</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    Each user begins their journey with £300m, a budget to strategically build
    their dream team. The value of players fluctuates based on community ratings
    within the DAO. If a player's performance garners enough votes, their value
    can either increase or decrease by £0.25m each gameweek.
  </p>
  <p class="my-2">
    In terms of team structure, each user's team consists of 11 players. Picking
    from a range of clubs is key, so a maximum of two players from any single
    club can be selected. Teams must adhere to a valid formation: 1 goalkeeper,
    3-5 defenders, 3-5 midfielders, and 1-3 strikers.
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-header mt-4">Transfers and Team Management</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    Flexibility is a cornerstone of our gameplay. Users can make up to three
    transfers per week, allowing for dynamic team management and adaptation to
    the ever-changing football landscape. These transfers don't roll over,
    encouraging active participation each week. There are no substitutes in our
    game, eliminating the frustration of unused bench points.
  </p>
  <p class="my-2">
    Each January, users can overhaul their team completely once, adding another
    strategic layer to the game reflecting the January transfer window.
  </p>
  <p class="my-2">
    If a player is transferred from a club they are removed from any fantasy
    team that contains them. This will leave a space in your team you must fill
    when saving your team next.
  </p>
  <p class="my-2">
    If the DAO votes to change a player's position, for example from a forward to a midfielder, then the player is removed from any fantasy
    team that contains them. This will again leave a space in your team you must fill
    when saving your team next. 
  </p>
  <p class="my-2">
    Scores will still be calculated on teams with
    less than 11 players that have not saved their team in the gameweek.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="default-header mt-4">Scoring System</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
