  <h1 class="default-header">Our Vision</h1>
  <p class="my-4">OpenFPL was created as our answer to the question:</p>
  <p class="my-2">
    <i
      >"How do you introduce the most new users to the Internet Computer
      Blockchain?"</i
    >.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    Football is the most popular sport in the world, with billions of fans, the
    leading fantasy football game engages over 10 million players a season.
    OpenFPL is a better, more equitable, decentralised fantasy football platform
    for football fans worldwide. We have used our football knowledge to create a
    more engaging game, coupled with token distribution to ensure users are more
    equitably rewarded for their successful pariticipation.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4 default-header">Why The Internet Computer?</p>
  <p>
    The Internet Computer (IC) is the only computer system in the world that
    allows users of an online service to truly own that service. The IC's unique
    architecture allows the interface the user engages with to be stored on the
    network, bypassing the big tech companies who do not have an interest in
    providing decentralised services. The IC not only has the capabilities to
    shift power structures in the tech world, it is built with its own
    decentralised service creation infrastructure that allow services like
    OpenFPL to become Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs). OpenFPL
    will transform fantasy Premier League football using this DAO architecture
    into a decentralised service that is more engaging for its users, rewarding
    football fans for their insight and participation in football.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    OpenFPL is more than a decentralised service, it is a brand that has
    multiple viable revenue streams. The ICPFA will distribute this value to
    token holders through inflation resistant tokenomics. Through a
    mechanisation of purchasing & burning exchange $FPL, we aim to keep the
    total supply at 100 million, while building up a healthy treasury for the
    DAO to utilise as it wishes.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    OpenFPL will create a platform Premier League fans feel at home using, with
    their input shaping the service. Our features are designed to enhance user
    engagement on the platform. These include more detailed and varied gameplay,
    community-based player valuations, customisable private leagues, and
    collaborations with football content creators. As we attract more users,
    engagement within the OpenFPL ecosystem will grow, which should contribute
    to the growth and value of the $FPL governance token.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    Our vision for OpenFPL encompasses a commitment to societal impact,
    specifically through our organisation, the ICPFA. The ICPFA will be focused
    on supporting grassroots football initiatives, demonstrating our belief in
    OpenFPL's ability to bring about positive change in the football community
    using the IC.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4 mb-4">
    In essence OpenFPL will be the world's game on the world's computer. A truly
    decentralised service, the fans home for Premier League football.
