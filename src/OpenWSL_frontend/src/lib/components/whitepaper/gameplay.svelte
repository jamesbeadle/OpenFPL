  <h1 class="default-header">OpenFPL Gameplay</h1>
  <p class="my-4">
    OpenFPL has been designed to create a unique and engaging fantasy football
    experience. We understand the passion and strategy that goes into fantasy
    football, and our gameplay rules are crafted to reflect this, enhancing the
    fun and competitiveness of each gameweek.
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-header">Starting Funds and Team Composition</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    Each user begins their season with a £300m budget to build their fantasy
    team. A player's value can change based on their performance if a proposal
    is raised to change their value up or down. If the proposal passes, their
    value can either increase or decrease by £0.25m each gameweek.
  </p>
  <p class="my-2">
    A user's team consists of 11 players. Picking from a range of clubs is key,
    so a maximum of 2 players from any single club can be selected. Teams must
    adhere to a valid formation: 1 goalkeeper, 3-5 defenders, 3-5 midfielders,
    and 1-3 strikers.
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-header mt-4">Transfers and Team Management</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    To give managers flexibility, we give you 3 new transfers each week. These
    transfers don't roll over, encouraging active participation each week. There
    are no substitutes in our game, eliminating the frustration of unused bench
    points.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    Each January, users can overhaul their team completely once, adding another
    strategic layer to the game reflecting the January transfer window.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    If a player is loaned or transferred from a club they are removed from any
    fantasy team that contains them. This will leave a space in your team you
    must fill when saving your team next.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    If the DAO votes to change a player's position, for example from a forward
    to a midfielder, then the player is again removed from any fantasy team that
    contains them.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    Scores will still be calculated on teams with less than 11 players that have
    not updated their team since an automatic system change.
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-header mt-4">Scoring System</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    Our scoring system rewards players for key contributions on the field:
