  <h1 class="default-header">Roadmap</h1>
  <p class="my-4">We have an ambitious roadmap of features:</p>
  <h2 class="default-sub-header mt-4">Jan - Feb 2024: SNS Testing</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    We will perform comprehensive testing of the OpenFPL gameplay and governance
    features. Detailed descriptions and outcomes of various use case tests,

  <h2 class="default-sub-header mt-4">
    March 1st 2024: OpenFPL SNS Decentralisation Sale
  </h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    We aim to begin our decentralisation sale in March 2024, selling 25 million
    $FPL tokens (25%).
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-sub-header mt-4">April 2024: Shirt Production Begins</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    We are actively engaged in shirt production for OpenFPL, moving beyond mere
    concepts to tangible products. Our collaboration with a UK supplier is set
    to kit out 200 junior clubs with OpenFPL-branded shirts for charity, marking
    our first foray into merging style with the spirit of the game. This
    initiative is further elevated by a successful partnership with OpenChat. A
    recent proposal in the OpenChat DAO has been passed, resulting in OpenChat
    sponsoring half of these shirts, a testament to our collaborative efforts
    and shared vision. Concurrently, we are in advanced talks with a
    manufacturer in India, having already developed a promising prototype. We
    are fine-tuning the details to perfect the shirts, with production
    anticipated to commence in just a few months. Additionally, these shirts
    will be available for sale in the ICPFA shop, with a portion of each sale
    benefiting our NFT holders. This dual approach not only strengthens our
    brand presence but also underscores our commitment to supporting grassroots
    football communities and providing value to our NFT investors.
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-sub-header mt-4">May 2024: Online Marketing Campaigns</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    We are actively in discussions with a digital marketing agency, preparing to
    launch campaigns aimed at organically growing our base of genuine managers.
    The strategy being formulated focuses on SEO and PPC methods aligned with
    OpenFPL's objectives. These deliberations include choosing the most suitable
    online platforms and crafting a strategy that resonates with our ethos. The
    direction of these campaigns is geared towards measurable outcomes,
    especially in attracting genuine manager sign-ups and naturally expanding
    our online footprint. This approach is designed to cultivate a genuine and
    engaged community, enhancing OpenFPL's presence in a manner that's both
    authentic and impactful.

    structure, with features such as: Deciding on the entry fee, if any. Any

    audio-based, these podcasts will eventually include video content, adding
    another dimension to our engagement strategy.
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-sub-header mt-4">July 2024: OpenFPL Events</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    OpenFPL is set to create a series of interactive experiences at event
    locations in Premier League club cities, drawing inspiration from major UK
    brands like IBM, Ford and Coca-Cola. Planned from Q2 2024 onwards, these
    events will leverage the expertise of OpenFPL founder James Beadle. With his
    experience in creating successful and engaging interactive experiences,
    James will play a key role in educating attendees about OpenFPL, Internet
    Identity and the range of other IC dApps available.
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-sub-header mt-4">July 2024: Mobile App Launch</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    We will release a mobile app shortly before the genesis season begins to

    content.
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-sub-header mt-4">Future: 100% On-Chain AI</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    At OpenFPL, we are exploring the deployment of a 100% on-chain AI model
    within a dedicated canister. Our initial use case for this AI would be to
    integrate a feature within the team selection interface, allowing users to
    receive AI-recommended changes. Users will then have the option to review
    and decide whether to implement these AI suggestions in their team
    management decisions. However, given that the Internet Computer's
    infrastructure is still evolving, especially in terms of on-chain training
    capabilities, our immediate strategy involves training the model off-chain.
    As the IC infrastructure evolves we would look to transition to real-time,
    continual learning for the AI model directly on the IC. Looking ahead, we're
    excited about the potential to develop new models using our constantly
    expanding on-chain dataset, opening up more innovative possibilities for
    OpenFPL.
